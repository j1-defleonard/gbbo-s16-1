# **App Name**: Bake Off Fantasy League

## Core Features:

- Draft Selection: Implement a draft system where players select bakers in a randomized order. A 'tool' determines the draft order for each round.
- Team Management: Allow users to manage their team by trading bakers with other players or dropping bakers and adding unclaimed bakers.
- Live Scoring: Automatically calculate and update scores each week based on baker performance.
- Point Tracking: Detail point breakdowns for each baker, showing how points were earned each week based on in-show actions.
- Elimination Tracking: Keep track of bakers eliminated each week, and remove them from future scoring.
- Preview Environment: Create a preview mode with pre-filled user data, auto-drafting, simulated trades and drops to showcase app functionality.
- Baker Ranking Suggestions: Provide a view to the user with suggestions of how the current bakers would rank based on scoring probability. Use AI to determine likeliness of handshakes from Paul Hollywood based on history.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Rich, inviting cream (#F8F0E3) evokes a sense of warmth and comfort, similar to a freshly baked cake. This color will be prominent in the application's header and other key UI elements.
- Background color: Soft beige (#E5DCCF) provides a subtle backdrop that complements the cream primary color without being distracting.
- Accent color: Muted berry (#A23B72) will be used for highlights, buttons, and interactive elements, drawing attention to key actions without overpowering the warm palette.
- Font pairing: 'Playfair' (serif) for headlines, 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body.
- Use flat, minimalist icons in the muted berry color to represent actions like trading, dropping, and viewing scores.
- Employ a card-based layout for baker profiles and weekly score breakdowns to create a clean and organized presentation.
- Incorporate subtle animations for actions like drafting and scoring updates to provide a dynamic and engaging user experience.
